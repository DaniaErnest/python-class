# Comparison Operators
# In this lecture we will be learning about Comparison Operators in Python.
#  These operators will allow us to compare variables and output a Boolean value (True or False).

# If you have any sort of background in Math, these operators should be very straight forward.

print(1 == 0)

print(2 != 2)

print(2 < 4)

print(2 < 1)

print(2 >= 2)

print(2 >= 1)

print(2 <= 2)

print(2 <= 4)


# Chained Comparison Operators
# An interesting feature of Python is the ability to chain multiple comparisons to perform a more complex test.
#  You can use these chained comparisons as shorthand for larger Boolean Expressions.

# In this lecture we will learn how to chain comparison operators and we will also introduce two other important statements in Python: and and or.

# Let's look at a few examples of using chains:

print(1 < 2 < 3)

print(1<2 and 2<3)

print(1 < 3 > 2)

print(1<3 and 3>2)

print(1==2 or 2<3)

print(1==1 or 100==1)
